//////////////////// Requirements ////////////////////

Accomplished the following:

MVC Architecture for application.
Drawing in main window, timeline synchronization, playback support.
Layout dynamic and designed appropriately. (Without the support of Full size and fit size)
Color choosing and width selection supported and explicitly maintained.

Data is saved with XML format.

*PS: I have had 6 midterms , 6 assignments including Operating Systems(CS 350) and Algorithms (CS 341) over the course of 2 weeks.
